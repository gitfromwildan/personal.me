Yo! Welcome to the editor. If you're reading this, you probably want to know how to make your blog posts look **sick** using our custom components. 

Don't worry, it's super easy. I got you. Let's break it down, casual style.

## The Basics

Writing here is just like writing standard Markdown, but with superpowers. You can bold stuff, *italicize* it, or even add code blocks like a pro.

```javascript:vibes.js
const mood = "chill";
console.log(`Current vibe: ${mood}`);
```

But that's boring. Let's get to the cool stuff.

## Custom Components

We have a bunch of custom components you can use directly in your MDX files. Here's the cheat sheet.

### Cards
Want to link to something in style? Use a card. It's like a button, but bigger and with more personality.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Github" icon="Github" href="https://github.com/gitfromwildan">
    Check out my open source work.
  </Card>
  <Card title="X" icon="Twitter" href="https://x.com/wildan_nrss">
    Follow me for random tech hot takes.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

**How to write it:**
```mdx
<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Github" icon="Github" href="...">
    Check out my open source work.
  </Card>
  // write the same card for X...
</CardGroup>
```

### Accordions
Got a lot of text but don't want to clutter the page? Hide it in an accordion. Peek-a-boo!

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Is this difficult to learn?" icon="HelpCircle">
    Nope! It's actually super intuitive once you get the hang of it.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I use icons?" icon="Star">
    Absolutely. We use Lucide icons, so you have plenty of choices.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

**The code:**
```mdx
<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Question?" icon="HelpCircle">
    Answer goes here!
  </Accordion>
  // write the same accordion for Can I use icons?...
</AccordionGroup>
```

### Tabs
Perfect for showing different options, like code in different languages or multiple steps.

<Tabs defaultValue="npm">
  <TabsList>
    <TabsTrigger value="npm">npm</TabsTrigger>
    <TabsTrigger value="pnpm">pnpm</TabsTrigger>
    <TabsTrigger value="bun">bun</TabsTrigger>
  </TabsList>
  <TabsContent value="npm">
    ```bash
    npm install @docubook/create@latest
    ```
  </TabsContent>
  <TabsContent value="pnpm">
    ```bash
    pnpm add @docubook/create@latest
    ```
  </TabsContent>
  <TabsContent value="bun">
    ```bash
    bun add @docubook/create@latest
    ```
  </TabsContent>
</Tabs>

### Stepper
Want to guide someone through a process? The Stepper component is your best friend.

<Stepper>
  <StepperItem title="Step 1: Relax">
    Take a deep breath. You're doing great.
  </StepperItem>
  <StepperItem title="Step 2: Write">
    Just start typing. Don't overthink it.
  </StepperItem>
  <StepperItem title="Step 3: Publish">
    Hit that deploy button and share it with the world!
  </StepperItem>
</Stepper>

### Buttons
Sometimes a simple link isn't enough. You need a **Button**.

<div className="flex gap-2">
  <Button text="Primary Action" href="#" />
  <Button text="Secondary" href="#" variation="outline" />
</div>

## Wrapping Up

See? Writing with Markdown is a breeze. It's clean, fast, and handles all the heavy lifting for you. 

Now go forth and create something awesome! 🚀
