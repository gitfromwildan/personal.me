Let's be real. Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) for Git are nice, but the **terminal** is where the real magic happens. It's faster, more powerful, and honestly, it just looks cooler.

If you're ready to take off the training wheels, this guide is for you.

## Installation

Before you can be a Git wizard, you need to install it. If `git --version` gives you an error, you need this.

  Get the latest version for Mac, Windows, or Linux from the official site.

## First Time Setup

Before you start committing code, you need to tell Git who you are. This identifies the author of the work.

<Tabs defaultValue="config">
  <TabsList>
    <TabsTrigger value="config">Configuration</TabsTrigger>
    <TabsTrigger value="check">Verify</TabsTrigger>
  </TabsList>
  <TabsContent value="config">
    Run these commands once to set your identity:
    ```bash
    git config --global user.name "Your Name"
    git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
    ```
  </TabsContent>
  <TabsContent value="check">
    Check if it worked:
    ```bash
    git config --list
    ```
  </TabsContent>
</Tabs>

## The Daily Workflow

Most of your time with Git will be a repeatable cycle. Here is the standard flow for saving your work.

<Stepper>
  <StepperItem title="Step 1: Check Status">
    Always know where you stand. Access the current state of your repository.
    ```bash
    git status
    ```
  </StepperItem>
  <StepperItem title="Step 2: Stage Changes">
    Pick the files you want to save.
    ```bash
    git add .
    ```
    *Pro tip: `.` adds everything. Use specific filenames to be more precise.*
  </StepperItem>
  <StepperItem title="Step 3: Commit">
    Save the snapshot with a meaningful message.
    ```bash
    git commit -m "fix: resolve infinite loop in login"
    ```
  </StepperItem>
  <StepperItem title="Step 4: Push">
    Send it to the cloud (GitHub/GitLab).
    ```bash
    git push origin main
    ```
  </StepperItem>
</Stepper>

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="My history is messy, can I squash it?" icon="GitMerge">

## Final Thoughts

Mastering the terminal takes muscle memory. Force yourself to use it for a week, and you'll never go back to clicking buttons.
